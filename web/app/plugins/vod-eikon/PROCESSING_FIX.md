# VOD Eikon Plugin - Video Processing Fix

## Problem Solved

The VOD Eikon plugin had an issue where videos uploaded via the plugin would be added to the Infomaniak service and WordPress database, but were missing the poster image and MPD URL. This happened because videos need time to process on Infomaniak's servers after upload, and the initial sync occurred before processing was complete.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automatic Retry Mechanism

- **Scheduled Processing Checks**: After each video upload, the system automatically schedules checks at 2, 5, 10, and 30 minutes to update incomplete videos
- **Hourly Background Updates**: A cron job runs every hour to check for and update any videos still missing poster/MPD data
- **Individual Video Tracking**: Each uploaded video is tracked individually with targeted API calls

### 2. Manual Update Controls

- **"Update Incomplete Videos" Button**: Allows administrators to manually trigger updates for processing videos
- **Incomplete Video Counter**: Button shows count of videos still processing with a visual badge
- **Processing Statistics**: Debug functionality to view completion rates and identify incomplete videos

### 3. Visual Indicators

- **Table Highlighting**: Incomplete videos are highlighted with yellow background and orange border
- **Processing Status Icons**: Videos still processing show a pulsing clock icon with "Processing" label
- **Color-coded Indicators**: Missing posters and MPD URLs are clearly marked in red

### 4. User Communication

- **Processing Notices**: Clear information about expected processing times (5-30 minutes)
- **Upload Tab Notice**: Explains processing behavior when uploading new videos
- **Video List Notice**: Shows count of incomplete videos and explains automatic updates

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling

- **API Rate Limiting**: Includes delays between API calls to avoid rate limits
- **Robust Error Logging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting processing issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even if some updates fail

## Technical Implementation

### New Methods Added:

1. `update_incomplete_videos()` - Checks and updates videos missing data
2. `check_video_processing_status()` - Handles individual video status checks
3. `ajax_update_incomplete_videos()` - AJAX handler for manual updates
4. `test_incomplete_video_processing()` - Debug functionality for statistics

### New Scheduled Events:

1. `vod_eikon_update_incomplete_videos` - Hourly background updates
2. `vod_eikon_check_video_processing` - Individual video processing checks

### Enhanced Admin Interface:

1. Visual processing indicators in video table
2. Update incomplete videos button with counter
3. Processing statistics and debug tools
4. Informational notices about processing times

### CSS Improvements:

1. Incomplete video highlighting styles
2. Processing indicator animations
3. Badge styling for button counters

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators:

1. **Upload Videos**: Upload as normal - system will automatically handle processing updates
2. **Monitor Progress**: Check the admin table for processing indicators
3. **Manual Updates**: Use "Update Incomplete Videos" button if needed
4. **Debug Tools**: Use "Processing Stats" to view completion rates

### For Developers:

1. **Logs**: Check WordPress debug logs for processing updates
2. **Cron Jobs**: Monitor scheduled events in wp-admin
3. **API Calls**: Individual video checks avoid full sync overhead

## Expected Behavior

1. **Immediate**: Video appears in admin table after upload (may show as processing)
2. **2-30 minutes**: System automatically updates poster and MPD URL as processing completes
3. **Visual Feedback**: Processing indicators disappear when video is complete
4. **Fallback**: Manual update button available if automatic updates don't work

## Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Clear visual feedback about video processing status
- **Automated Management**: No manual intervention required for most videos
- **Efficient API Usage**: Targeted updates instead of full synchronization
- **Robust Error Handling**: System recovers gracefully from temporary API issues
- **Debug Capabilities**: Tools to monitor and troubleshoot processing issues

This solution ensures that all uploaded videos eventually receive their poster images and MPD URLs, while providing clear communication to users about the processing status.
